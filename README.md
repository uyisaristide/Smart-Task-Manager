# Task Manager - Flutter Practical Exam

## Overview
This Flutter application is a **Task Manager**, built as part of a practical exam for a software developer role. The app allows users to manage tasks efficiently with features like authentication, real-time synchronization, offline support, push notifications, and advanced state management.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Task Management
- Display a list of tasks with **title, description, priority, due date, and status**.
- Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as **completed**.
- Implemented **search and filter** system (by priority, status, and due date).

### ✅ User Authentication
- Integrated **Firebase Authentication** with Google Sign-In and Email/Password login.
- Ensured API calls are secured using Firebase Authentication tokens.

### ✅ Real-time Database
- Tasks are stored in **Firebase Firestore**, allowing real-time data synchronization.
- Implemented **offline mode**: Tasks remain accessible without an internet connection and sync automatically when back online.

### ✅ Push Notifications & Reminders
- Used **flutter_local_notifications** for task reminders.
- Implemented **background scheduling** using `workmanager` for persistent notifications.

### ✅ State Management & Architecture
- Used **Riverpod** with **Notifiers and Providers** for state management.
- Followed **Clean Architecture** principles with a modular structure:
  - **routes/** → App navigation using **GoRouter**.
  - **providers/** → State management using **Riverpod**.
  - **models/** → Data models for tasks.
  - **Views/** → UI components and screens.
  - **constants/** → Global constants and theme configurations.

### ✅ Theming & Dark Mode
- Implemented **light & dark mode switching**.
- Allowed users to customize primary theme colors dynamically.

### ✅ CI/CD & Testing
- Added **unit tests** for business logic and **widget tests** for UI verification.
- Configured **GitHub Actions** for automated testing and CI/CD pipeline.
